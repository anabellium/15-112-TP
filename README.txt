Project Title: School Flirting Game

My project "School Flirting Game" is a minigame inspired by a 2010s flashgame of the same title. In it, the user plays as a high school girl with the main objective of making as many high school boys fall in love with her as possible. They do this by using the mouse to deplete boys of their HP! They also must complete with other girls in their school, called "rivals," who will try to heal targeted boys as they are being attacked. 

The code for my project is in the .py file "TP3"
The folder "sprites' contains all the image assets used in my project. Because I created my own sprite strips from gifs, each sprite has its own folder containing the gif, the transparent background gif, the spritesheet, and another folder containing each individual frame. THE CITATIONS FOR EACH GIF ARE INCLUDED IN A .TXT FILE IN THE RESPECTIVE SPRITE FOLDER! AND ARE NOT PART OF THE CODE!
